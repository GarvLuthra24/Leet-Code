Input: edges = [2,0,0,2]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- The nodes 1 and 2 have an edge pointing to node 0. The edge score of node 0 is 1 + 2 = 3.
- The nodes 0 and 3 have an edge pointing to node 2. The edge score of node 2 is 0 + 3 = 3.
Nodes 0 and 2 both have an edge score of 3. Since node 0 has a smaller index, we return 0.
